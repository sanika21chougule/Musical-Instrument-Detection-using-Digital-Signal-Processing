# Musical-Instrument-Detection-using-Digital-Signal-Processing
Musical instrument detection with DSP involves analyzing audio signals to identify the type of instrument playing. The process starts with capturing the sound and converting it into a digital signal. Feature extraction techniques like Fourier Transform, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), and spectral analysis are used.
